![Profile picture, Niagara](pages/images/headshot.jpg){: .img-left}

I am a master's student at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU MSR). I am working in the [Field Robotics Center](https://frc.ri.cmu.edu/) with [George Kantor](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/george-a-kantor/) on agricultural robotics applications, focusing on outdoor imaging and reconstruction.

Previously I worked for six years at [RightHand Robotics](https://www.righthandrobotics.com/), a piece-picking robotics startup in the Boston area. It was a privilege to watch this startup grow up, and a great learning experience.
