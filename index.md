<!-- TODO: Update my resume! -->

![Profile picture, Niagara](pages/images/headshot.jpg){: .img-left-180w}

I am a master's student at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU MSR). I am working in the [Field Robotics Center](https://frc.ri.cmu.edu/) with [George Kantor](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/george-a-kantor/) on agricultural robotics applications, focusing on outdoor imaging and reconstruction.

Previously I worked for six years at [RightHand Robotics](https://www.righthandrobotics.com/), a piece-picking robotics startup in the Boston area. It was a privilege to watch this startup grow up, as well as a great learning experience.

I'm interested in making useful work happen with computer vision. I feel like every robotics project has to start with perception, and all of the downstream actions and decisions rely on good decisions in that initial assessment of the world. While at CMU I'm doing my best to dive into imaging, machine learning for image processing, and 3D reconstruction.

#### Projects

Here is a collection of past projects that I had documentation for, some serious and some fun.

#### Interests

Other random interests include [running](pages/images/sehome_xc.jpg), [hiking](pages/images/hiking_2.jpg), [choir](pages/images/powerchords.jpg) <sub><sup>(shout-out to [Revels](https://revels.org/))</sup></sub>, [soccer](pages/images/soccer.jpg), and [fire arts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16Lut_dGIvgzn5PNNoVQJHhjt5TUXKUw_/view?usp=sharing) <sub><sup>(shout-out to [Wildfire](https://www.wildfireretreat.org/))</sup></sub>.

One fun suggestion - if you use git and have access to any large repositories with many contributors, do yourself a favor and run `gource`, then sit back and enjoy. This is a wonderful tool.
